== Installation ==

**Install**

1. Download the plugin and upload the entire `wppizza` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.  
Alternatively you can download and install WPPizza using the built in WordPress plugin installer.  
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.  
3. You will find all configuration and menu options in your administration sidebar  


**Things to do on first install**

For consistency, this document has now moved to the following location :   
<a href='https://docs.wp-pizza.com/getting-started/?section=setup'>https://docs.wp-pizza.com/getting-started/?section=setup</a>  
** I strongly encourage you to read it **  


**Uninstall**

Please note:  
Although all options, menu items and menu categories get deleted from the database along with the table that holds any orders you may have received, you will manually have to delete any additional pages (such as the order page for example) that have been created as i have no way of knowing if you are using this page elsewhere or have changed the content/name of it.  
The same goes for the 3 example icons that come with this plugin as they might be in use elsewhere.
